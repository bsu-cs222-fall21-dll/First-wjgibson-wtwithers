Error Documentation: When running, an error pops up saying "Failed to load class 'org.slf4j.impl.staticLoggerBinder".<br/>
This error has no effect on the result of the program and does not cause any kind of compiler mishaps. It was left because the fix (adding a dependency in the pom.xml file) could not be done. The "pom.xml" file was read-only.
